# static version of my website

> [!NOTE]
> this page will be fully revamped as soon as i am not busy, so none of this is final;
> also once i find a server-host i can stick to, this repro will be **deleted**

this is a static version of my website as i cannot find a sustainable host for the server, so i'm gonna use static pages instead:

any personal info / credentials have been removed.

feel free to look through the files and html if you'd like.
